# Backend service for Sandy Ditto Real Estate
This project is the backend support for [Sandy Ditto Real Estate](https://www.sandydittorealestate.com). The function behind this Node.js server is to send emails through nodemailer. This is also my first hands-on experience with node.js and using it's backend capabilities with React.js

You can find the frontend environment for this project [here](https://github.com/domstrevino/Ditto-Real-Estate_Frontend).
